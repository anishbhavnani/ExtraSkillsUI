# About ExtraSkillsUI

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.7.

ExtraSkills UI is part of SOA project developed to provide extra creative skills like dance,singing,music,fitness,language learning etc. for free.
Anyone can register and get regular updates of free workshops being held live. The aim is to spread knowledge for free to the world community and specially to kids deprived of education and other skills.

The UI part is developed in Angular 7 and Bootstrap 4. Whereas the backend part is developed in Spring Boot with additional security to allow only registered members to view the workshops. The only purpose of registering is to get insight of which skills people are more interested in so that the team can prioritize the work in advance.

The project open for anyone who wants to use it for personal/commercial use.
